In this project, I used JS to leverage two apis to access and display words and information about those words. Note: I do not control the apis used to create this app. 

Also, there is some issues with the random word api. As of now the owner took down the api, so I am not sure if it will be back up. This just influences the random word aspect of the application. Users can still enter in their own words.
